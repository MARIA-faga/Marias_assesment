1)Self Portrait= this is code done in OPEN PROCESSING as we learned about the basics of coding in p5.js exploring the fundamentals of color, 2D shape and mouse interaction.

2) Tennis Court Match= Also done in OPEN PROCESSING, i learned how to generate a code through "if" statements and "let" and use of "Random".i created the tenniscort through lines, fill,stroke and streokeweight and animated the ball using if statements and speed.

 3)RISEN KING= Another example of mouse interaction and creating an illustration through lines, fill, stroke, strokeweight adding in the coordinates and RGB codes to create such a picture.

4) Feed Back/Pattern Loop= I learned how to do this code on "Touch Designer. where I got to explore how to use COMP, and tile tops and
create a feedback loop.

5) SOPS& INSTANCING= Also in TOUCH DESIGNER in this code we were able to dive deeper into SOPS (Surface Operators) which generate and modify whatever surface.There was alot of use of translate,grid, box,geo,camera and light. Overall very interesting to experiment with INSTANCING.

6) AUDIO REACTIVE PATTERN= in Touch Designer we created patterns through our circle and sphere sops connected them to top operators(cam,geo,light and render) added and attached an audio and connected it to the TWIST to make the pattern audio recative.
